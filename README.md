# Multi-Source RAG Platform

This project is a sophisticated, local-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform designed to transform a diverse range of organizational content—including PDFs, Office documents, emails, and images—into an interactive and searchable knowledge base. It is built for anyone who needs to derive reliable answers from in-house documentation without compromising data privacy.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Supports a wide variety of file formats, including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, and TXT. *EML support is currently experimental. XLSX ingestion is under development.*
*   **Configurable Chunking**: Employs a rule-based chunking system that allows for different strategies (e.g., by paragraph, by slide) to be applied to different document types, ensuring optimal data segmentation.
*   **Flexible Embedding Models**: Easily switch between local, open-source embedding models (via `sentence-transformers`) and powerful API-based models like OpenAI's.
*   **Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Capable of retrieving both text and image-based information. The system includes an `enrich-images` command to generate textual descriptions for images using an agentic workflow, making visual content fully searchable.
*   **Advanced Retrieval Strategies**: Uses a late-fusion approach to combine results from multiple sources, ensuring comprehensive and relevant context for every query.
*   **Streamlit UI**: An intuitive user interface for creating and managing projects, uploading documents, and editing configurations.
*   **Command-Line Interface**: A powerful CLI for interacting with the platform, allowing you to ingest documents, generate embeddings, and ask questions directly from your terminal.
*   **Local-First and Secure**: All your data, including raw files, indexes, and logs, is stored locally on your machine, ensuring complete privacy and control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   Poetry for dependency management
*   An API key for your chosen LLM and embedding providers (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies using Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

### Usage

The platform can be operated through the Streamlit UI or the command-line interface.

#### Streamlit UI

To launch the user interface, run the following command:
```bash
poetry run streamlit run scripts/ui/ui_project_manager.py
```
The UI allows you to:
- Create new projects.
- Upload documents.
- View and edit project configurations.

#### Command-Line Interface

The CLI provides a powerful way to interact with the platform. Here is a typical workflow:

1.  **Ingest and Chunk Documents:**
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli ingest /path/to/your/project --chunk
    ```

2.  **Generate Embeddings:**
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli embed /path/to/your/project
    ```
    *Optional: Use `--with-image-index` to run image enrichment and indexing immediately after embedding.*

3.  **Enrich and Index Images (Standalone):**
    If you didn't use `--with-image-index` during embedding, you can run these steps separately:
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli enrich-images /path/to/your/project --doc-type pptx
    python -m app.cli index-images /path/to/your/project --doc-type pptx
    ```

4.  **Retrieve Context:**
    Test the retrieval system directly:
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli retrieve /path/to/your/project "Your search query" --top-k 5
    ```

5.  **Ask a Question:**
    Generate an answer using the RAG pipeline:
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli ask /path/to/your/project "Your question here"
    ```

6.  **View Configuration:**
    Check the current project configuration:
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli config /path/to/your/project
    ```

For more detailed information on the available commands and their options, please refer to the `app/README.md` file.

## Core Concepts

The platform is built around a modular pipeline that processes your data in several stages:

1.  **Ingestion**: The first step is to ingest your raw documents. The platform provides a suite of loaders that can handle a wide variety of file formats.
2.  **Chunking**: Once ingested, the documents are split into smaller, more manageable chunks. This process is highly configurable and can be tailored to the specific characteristics of each document type.
3.  **Enrichment**: The platform includes an `ImageInsightAgent` that can analyze images and generate textual descriptions for them. This makes visual content searchable and adds another layer of context to your knowledge base.
4.  **Embedding**: The text and image chunks are then converted into numerical representations (embeddings) using a chosen embedding model.
5.  **Indexing**: The embeddings are stored in a local FAISS index, which allows for efficient similarity searches.
6.  **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the platform uses a late-fusion retrieval strategy to find the most relevant text and image chunks from the index.
7.  **Generation**: The retrieved context is then used to construct a detailed prompt, which is sent to a large language model to generate a final answer.
